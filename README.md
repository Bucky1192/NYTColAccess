### More information

Contact Adam Ross Nelson for more information. The NYT authors first established a sample of institutions with overall high graduation rates. The NYT then contacted those institutions to request data. Comprable data is publically available from the [US DOE Integrated Post Secondary Education Data System] (https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/Home/UseTheData) and the [USDOE College Scorecard data set] (https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/).
